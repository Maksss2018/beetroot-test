      <p>
        Beetroot Academy is a Swedish-Ukrainian IT school. Students learn from
        teachers who are active in the industry, resulting in real, applicable
        knowledge.

      <p>Are you ready for a future in IT?</p>
      <p>
        In IT, experience is everything. Employers want developers capable of
        taking on projects and solving problems, things that only real
        experience can teach you. Thatâ€™s why the 100+ hours in class are heavily
        practical. Together with a senior practitioner, our groups become teams
        who work on real projects, just like in a company. Theory is studied
        independently via our web portal.
